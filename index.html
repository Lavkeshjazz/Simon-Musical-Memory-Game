                <h3>Rule 1</h3>
                <p>Press the START button. Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same character lens.</p>
                <h3>Rule 2</h3>
                <p>Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same character lenses, in order.</p>
                <h3>Rule 3</h3>
                <p>Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.</p>
                <h3>Rule 4</h3>
                <p>Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of siginals correctly.</p>
                <h3>Rule 5</h3>
                <p>If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, Simon responds with a "RAZZ" sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.</p>
                <h3>Rule 6</h3>
                <p>HAVE FUN! and try again again to beat your highscore.</p>
